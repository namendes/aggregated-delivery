          <h3>Early years</h3>

                                  <p>The first&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_watch" title="Digital watch">digital watch</a>, which debuted in 1972, was the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar_(watch)" title="Pulsar (watch)">Pulsar</a>&nbsp;manufactured by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Watch_Company" title="Hamilton Watch Company">Hamilton Watch Company</a>. "Pulsar" became a brand name which would later be acquired by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiko" title="Seiko">Seiko</a>&nbsp;in 1978. In 1982, a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar" title="Pulsar">Pulsar</a>&nbsp;watch (NL C01) was released which could store 24 digits, making it most likely the first watch with user-programmable memory, or "memorybank" watch.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-history-6">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;With the introduction of personal computers in the 1980s,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiko" title="Seiko">Seiko</a>&nbsp;began to develop computers in the form of watches. The Data 2000 watch (1983) came with an external keyboard for data-entry. Data was synced from the keyboard to the watch via electro-magnetic coupling (wireless docking). The name comes from its ability to store 2000 characters. The D409 was the first&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiko" title="Seiko">Seiko</a>&nbsp;model with on-board data entry (via a miniature keyboard) and featured a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix" title="Dot matrix">dot matrix</a>&nbsp;display.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-seiko-7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;Its memory was tiny, at only 112 digits.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-history-6">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;It was released in 1984, in gold, silver and black.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>&nbsp;These models were followed by many others by Seiko during the 1980s, most notably the "RC Series": During the 1980s,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio" title="Casio">Casio</a>&nbsp;began to market a successful line of "computer watches", in addition to its&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator_watch" title="Calculator watch">calculator watches</a>. Most notable was the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_data_bank" title="Casio data bank">Casio data bank</a>&nbsp;series. Novelty "game watches", such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelsonic_game_watch" title="Nelsonic game watch">Nelsonic game watches</a>, were also produced by Casio and other companies.<sup>[<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></em>]</sup></p>

                                  <h3>Seiko RC series</h3>

                                  <p>The RC-1000 Wrist Terminal was the first&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiko" title="Seiko">Seiko</a>&nbsp;model to interface with a computer, and was released in 1984.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-seiko-7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;It was developed by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiko_Epson" title="Seiko Epson">Seiko Epson</a>&nbsp;and was powered by a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_on_a_chip" title="Computer on a chip">computer on a chip</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>&nbsp;It was compatible with most of the popular PCs of that time, including&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc." title="Apple Inc.">Apple</a>&nbsp;II, II+ and IIe, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" title="Commodore 64">Commodore</a>&nbsp;64,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a>&nbsp;PC,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC" title="NEC">NEC</a>&nbsp;8201,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_Computers" title="Tandy Computers">Tandy</a>&nbsp;Color Computer, Model 1000, 1200, 2000 and TRS-80 Model I, III, 4 and 4p. The RC-20 Wrist Computer was released in 1985, under the joint brand name "Seiko Epson".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-Epson-11">[11]</a></sup>&nbsp;It had a SMC84C00 8-bit Z-80&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor" title="Microprocessor">microprocessor</a>; 8&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte" title="Kibibyte">KB</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory" title="Read-only memory">ROM</a>&nbsp;and 2&nbsp;KB of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory" title="Random-access memory">RAM</a>. It had applications for scheduling, memos, and world time and a four-function calculator app. The dot-matrix LCD displayed 42×32 pixels, and more importantly, was touch-sensitive. Like the RC-1000, it could be connected to a personal computer, in this case through a proprietary cable. It was also notable in that it could be programmed, although its small display and limited storage severely limited application development.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-seiko-7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;The RC-4000 PC Data graph also released in 1985, was dubbed the "world's smallest computer terminal".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-seiko-7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;It had 2&nbsp;KB of storage. The RC-4500 (1985), also known as the Wrist Mac, had the same features as the RC-4000, but came in a variety of bright, flashy colors.</p>

                                  <h3>1990s</h3>

                                  <p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Datalink" title="Timex Datalink">Timex Datalink</a>&nbsp;wristwatch, was introduced in 1994. The early Timex Datalink Smartwatches realized a wireless data transfer mode to communicate with a PC. Appointments and contacts created with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Schedule_Plus" title="Microsoft Schedule Plus">Microsoft Schedule+</a>, the predecessor of MS Outlook, could be easily transmitted to the watch via a screen blinking light protocol.</p>

                                  <p>In 1998,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Mann" title="Steve Mann">Steve Mann</a>&nbsp;invented, designed, and built the world's first Linux wristwatch,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-Patent_2275784-12">[12]</a></sup>&nbsp;which he presented at IEEE ISSCC2000 on 7 February 2000, where he was named "the father of wearable computing".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-ReferenceA-13">[13]</a></sup>&nbsp;See also Linux Journal,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>&nbsp;where Mann's Linux wristwatch appeared on the cover and was the feature article of LJ Issue 75. Seiko launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruputer" title="Ruputer">Ruputer</a>&nbsp;in Japan - a wristwatch computer with a 3.6&nbsp;MHz processor. It was not very successful, since instead of a touchscreen it used a joystick-like device to input characters (much like high scores in arcade games), and the small screen with a resolution at 102x64 in 4 greyscales made it hard to read large amounts of text. Outside of Japan, this watch was distributed as the Matsucom onHand PC. Despite the rather low demand, the Matsucom onHand PC was distributed until 2006, making it a smartwatch with a rather long life cycle. Ruputer and onHand PC applications are 100% compatible. This watch is sometimes considered the first smartwatch since it was the first watch to offer graphics display (albeit monochrome) and many 3rd party applications (mostly homebrew).</p>

                                  <p>In 1999,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung" title="Samsung">Samsung</a>&nbsp;launched the world's first watch phone, the SPH-WP10. It had a protruding antenna, a monochrome LCD screen, and a 90-minutes of talk time with an integrated speaker and microphone.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-samsungwatch-15">[15]</a></sup></p>

                                  <h3>2000s</h3>

                                  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stevemannwristcomp.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Stevemannwristcomp.jpg/220px-Stevemannwristcomp.jpg" width="220" alt="" height="331" /></a></p>

                                  <p>The first Linux Smartwatch<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-Patent_2275784-12">[12]</a></sup>&nbsp;was presented at IEEE ISSCC2000 on 7 February 2000, where presenter Steve Mann was named "the father of wearable computing".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-ReferenceA-13">[13]</a></sup>&nbsp;This watch also appeared on the cover and was the feature article of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Journal" title="Linux Journal">LJ</a>&nbsp;Issue 75.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup></p>

                                  <p>In June 2000,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a>&nbsp;displayed a prototype for a wristwatch that ran&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" title="Linux">Linux</a>. The original version had only 6 hours of battery life, which was later extended to 12.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>&nbsp;It featured 8&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte" title="Megabyte">MB</a>&nbsp;of memory and ran Linux 2.2.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-IBM-18">[18]</a></sup>&nbsp;The device was later upgraded with an accelerometer, vibrating mechanism, and fingerprint sensor. IBM began to collaborate with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Watch_Co." title="Citizen Watch Co.">Citizen Watch Co.</a>&nbsp;to create the "WatchPad". The WatchPad 1.5 features a 320 × 240&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QVGA" title="QVGA">QVGA</a>&nbsp;monochrome touch sensitive display and runs Linux 2.4.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-watchpad-19">[19]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>&nbsp;It also features calendar software,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth" title="Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a>, 8&nbsp;MB of RAM and 16&nbsp;MB of flash memory.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-PCWORLD-22">[22]</a></sup>&nbsp;Citizen was hoping to market the watch to students and businessmen, with a retail price of around $399.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-PCWORLD-22">[22]</a></sup>&nbsp;Epson Seiko introduced their Chrono-bit wristwatch in September 2000. The Chrono-bit watches feature a rotating bezel for data input, synchronize PIM data via a serial cable, and can load custom watch faces.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup></p>

                                  <p>In 2003, Fossil released the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_Wrist_PDA" title="Fossil Wrist PDA">Wrist PDA</a>, a watch which ran the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_OS" title="Palm OS">Palm OS</a>&nbsp;and contained 8 MB of RAM and 4 MB of flash memory.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-wired-24">[24]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-PCworld-25">[25]</a></sup>&nbsp;It contained a built in stylus to help use the tiny monochrome display, which had a resolution of 160×160 pixels. Although many reviewers declared the watch revolutionary, it was criticized for its weight (108 grams) and was ultimately discontinued in 2005.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-loungereview-26">[26]</a></sup></p>

                                  <p>In the same year, Microsoft announced the SPOT smartwatch and it began hitting stores in early 2004.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-:2-27">[27]</a></sup>&nbsp;SPOT stands for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Personal_Objects_Technology" title="Smart Personal Objects Technology">Smart Personal Objects Technology</a>, an initiative by Microsoft to personalize household electronics and other everyday gadgets. For instance, the company demonstrated coffee makers, weather stations, and alarm clocks featuring built-in SPOT technology.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-:3-28">[28]</a></sup>&nbsp;The device was a standalone smartwatch<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>&nbsp;that offered information at a glance where other devices would have required more immersion and interaction. The information included weather, news, stock prices, and sports scores and was transmitted through FM waves.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-:2-27">[27]</a></sup>&nbsp;It was accessible through a yearly subscription that cost from $39 to $59.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-:3-28">[28]</a></sup></p>

                                  <p>The Microsoft SPOT Watch had a monochrome 90×126 pixel screen.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>&nbsp;Fossil, Suunto, and Tissot also sold smartwatches running the SPOT technology. For instance, Fossil's Abacus, which was a variant of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_Wrist_PDA" title="Fossil Wrist PDA">Fossil Wrist PDA</a>, retailed from $130 to $150.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-:3-28">[28]</a></sup></p>

                                  <p>Sony Ericsson teamed up with Fossils, and released the first watch, MBW-100, that connected to Bluetooth. This watch notified the user when receiving calls and text messages. Though the watch was not popular as it would only connect and work with Sony Ericsson cell phones.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup></p>

                                  <p>In 2009, Hermen van den Burg, CEO of Smartwatch and Burg Wearables, launches&nbsp;<em>Burg</em>&nbsp;the first standalone smartphone watch which has its own sim card and does not require to be tethered to a smartphone.&nbsp;<em>Burg</em>&nbsp;receives the award for the Most Innovative Product at the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_Fair" title="Canton Fair">Canton Fair</a>&nbsp;in April 2009<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>&nbsp;Also,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung" title="Samsung">Samsung</a>&nbsp;launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=S9110_Watch_Phone&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="S9110 Watch Phone (page does not exist)">S9110 Watch Phone</a>&nbsp;which featured a 1.76-inch (45&nbsp;mm) color LCD display and was 11.98 millimetres (0.472&nbsp;in) thin.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-samsungwatch-15">[15]</a></sup></p>

                                  <ul>
                                  <li>The physical size of smartwatches is likely to be large.</li>
                                  <li>Insufficient battery life is an ongoing problem for smartwatch developers, as the battery life of devices at the time of publication was three to four days and this is likely to be reduced if further functions are added.</li>
                                  <li>New display technologies will be invented as a result of smartwatch research.</li>
                                  <li>The success level of smartwatches is unpredictable, as they may follow a similar trajectory to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook" title="Netbook">netbooks</a>, or they may fulfill aims akin to those of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass" title="Google Glass">Google Glass</a>, another wearable electronic product.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-Chris-57">[57]</a></sup></li>

                                  <p>Acer's S.T. Liew stated in an interview with British gadget website&nbsp;<em>Pocket-Lint</em>, "... I think every consumer company should be looking at wearable. Wearable isn’t new … it just hasn’t exploded in the way that it should.

Seiko launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruputer" title="Ruputer">Ruputer</a>&nbsp;in Japan - a wristwatch computer with a 3.6&nbsp;MHz processor. It was not very successful, since instead of a touchscreen it used a joystick-like device to input characters (much like high scores in arcade games), and the small screen with a resolution at 102x64 in 4 greyscales made it hard to read large amounts of text. Outside of Japan, this watch was distributed as the Matsucom onHand PC. Despite the rather low demand, the Matsucom onHand PC was distributed until 2006, making it a smartwatch with a rather long life cycle. Ruputer and onHand PC applications are 100% compatible. This watch is sometimes considered the first smartwatch since it was the first watch to offer graphics display (albeit monochrome) and many 3rd party applications (mostly homebrew).</p>

                                  <ul>
                                  <li>The physical size of smartwatches is likely to be large.</li>
                                  <li>Insufficient battery life is an ongoing problem for smartwatch developers, as the battery life of devices at the time of publication was three to four days and this is likely to be reduced if further functions are added.</li>
                                  <li>New display technologies will be invented as a result of smartwatch research.</li>
                                  <li>The success level of smartwatches is unpredictable, as they may follow a similar trajectory to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook" title="Netbook">netbooks</a>, or they may fulfill aims akin to those of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass" title="Google Glass">Google Glass</a>, another wearable electronic product.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-Chris-57">[57]</a></sup></li>

                                  <p>Acer's S.T. Liew stated in an interview with British gadget website&nbsp;<em>Pocket-Lint</em>, "... I think every consumer company should be looking at wearable. Wearable isn’t new … it just hasn’t exploded in the way that it should. But the opportunity’s for billions of dollars’ worth of industry."<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup></p>

"Pulsar" became a brand name which would later be acquired by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiko" title="Seiko">Seiko</a>&nbsp;in 1978. In 1982, a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar" title="Pulsar">Pulsar</a>&nbsp;watch (NL C01) was released which could store 24 digits, making it most likely the first watch with user-programmable memory, or "memorybank" watch.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-history-6">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;With the introduction of personal computers in the 1980s,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiko" title="Seiko">Seiko</a>&nbsp;began to develop computers in the form of watches. The Data 2000 watch (1983) came with an external keyboard for data-entry. Data was synced from the keyboard to the watch via electro-magnetic coupling (wireless docking). The name comes from its ability to store 2000 characters. The D409 was the first&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiko" title="Seiko">Seiko</a>&nbsp;model with on-board data entry (via a miniature keyboard) and featured a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix" title="Dot matrix">dot matrix</a>&nbsp;display.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-seiko-7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;Its memory was tiny, at only 112 digits.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-history-6">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;It was released in 1984, in gold, silver and black.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>&nbsp;These models were followed by many others by Seiko during the 1980s, most notably the "RC Series": During the 1980s,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio" title="Casio">Casio</a>&nbsp;began to market a successful line of "computer watches", in addition to its&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator_watch" title="Calculator watch">calculator watches</a>.

Like the RC-1000, it could be connected to a personal computer, in this case through a proprietary cable. It was also notable in that it could be programmed, although its small display and limited storage severely limited application development.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-seiko-7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;The RC-4000 PC Data graph also released in 1985, was dubbed the "world's smallest computer terminal".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-seiko-7">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;It had 2&nbsp;KB of storage.

The early Timex Datalink Smartwatches realized a wireless data transfer mode to communicate with a PC. Appointments and contacts created with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Schedule_Plus" title="Microsoft Schedule Plus">Microsoft Schedule+</a>, the predecessor of MS Outlook, could be easily transmitted to the watch via a screen blinking light protocol.</p>

                                  <p>In 1998,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Mann" title="Steve Mann">Steve Mann</a>&nbsp;invented, designed, and built the world's first Linux wristwatch,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-Patent_2275784-12">[12]</a></sup>&nbsp;which he presented at IEEE ISSCC2000 on 7 February 2000, where he was named "the father of wearable computing".<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-ReferenceA-13">[13]</a></sup>&nbsp;See also Linux Journal,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>&nbsp;where Mann's Linux wristwatch appeared on the cover and was the feature article of LJ Issue 75. Seiko launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruputer" title="Ruputer">Ruputer</a>&nbsp;in Japan - a wristwatch computer with a 3.6&nbsp;MHz processor. It was not very successful, since instead of a touchscreen it used a joystick-like device to input characters (much like high scores in arcade games), and the small screen with a resolution at 102x64 in 4 greyscales made it hard to read large amounts of text. Outside of Japan, this watch was distributed as the Matsucom onHand PC. Despite the rather low demand, the Matsucom onHand PC was distributed until 2006, making it a smartwatch with a rather long life cycle. Ruputer and onHand PC applications are 100% compatible. This watch is sometimes considered the first smartwatch since it was the first watch to offer graphics display (albeit monochrome) and many 3rd party applications (mostly homebrew).</p>
